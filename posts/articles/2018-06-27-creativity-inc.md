Creativity, Inc. is a terrific book by Ed Catmull, the president and cofounder of Pixar, who touches on many lessons learned and wisdom gained from running a company that consistently maintains its creativity. Pixar is a company known for consistently delivering high quality animated movies like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles to name a few. I figured, that since Pixar is a relatively large company with a lot of repeated successes, they must be relying on cool patterns and practices and not just having talented people. As someone from the tech industry where creativity and quality is a constant struggle, I was interested in learning how Pixar maintains creativity and how to apply their ideas in my own work.

To boil it down, Pixar was successful because it had a culture of open feedback, where everyone from top-down genuinely cares about quality movies. What was most memorable to me was actually not so much about the practices that Ed mentioned like their Braintrust meetings and Notes Day concept. My impressionable highlights were Ed’s inspiration from Japanese Manufacturing and his relationship with Steve Jobs.

## Ed’s inspiration from Japanese Manufacturing

**The responsibility for finding and fixing a problem is assigned to every employee no matter seniority.** Surprisingly, Ed drew much inspiration from creative processes used in Japanese manufacturing history, particularly from W. Edwards Deming’s ideas on “Total Quality Control.” Anyone at any level was expected to stop the assembly line if a defect is spotted, which is contrary to American assembly lines where the mantra was “always keep the line rolling”. By giving ownership of a product’s quality to the people for calling out problems and making suggestions, they start feeling a sense of pride in the work they do.

The idea that **people are entitled to take pride in their work** resonated very strongly with me. Though it may seem simple and obvious, I think it’s worth highlighting because very often many companies have jobs that can be really tedious and soul-draining. Working for companies, especially larger organizations, can carry a stigma of “unfun” like “ugh work, I can’t wait for this week to be over with” kind of attitude. What if more people in companies challenged their own creativities on how to improve their work? What if companies prioritized having a culture where each person is entitled to being proud of what they do?

Entitlement to pride was also meaningful because it related to another of my readings where Paul O’Neill changed Alcoa’s culture in The Power of Habit. Alcoa, an aluminum manufacturing company, had one of the worst mortality/casualty rates as well as failing product lines. When O’Neill first joined, without mentioning revenue projections or profit margins, he simply declared that safety was the primary focus. O’Neill, who was extremely adept at root-cause analyses, identified that safety was the button to press. This was an area of impact that could change people’s behaviors and attitudes that would lead to Alcoa’s later profitable successes. He, too, gave ownership to everyone in the company to finger point and stop the process if it meant making the machineries and processes safer to operate. Not only was this an effective tool for unifying the company, this goal was also a proud endeavor for all employees because people’s lives were being saved from it.

## How to resolve conflicts with Steve Jobs

Ed and Steve’s working dynamic was fascinating. Any time Ed tries to convince Steve his ideas, Steve will usually dismiss it. Ed would come back in a week to propose it again, and the outcome becomes one of the three:

1. Steve concedes and gives what Ed needed.
2. Ed sees that Steve was right and stops lobbying.
3. The debate becomes inconclusive, and Ed just pursues his idea anyways.

The takeaway for me is that sometimes “difficult” people could just have another language to speak in. While Steve may think he’s always right most of the time, he will respect the passion in people and will try to test others if they have the guts to pursue it. Figuring out this dynamic can be frustrating, but can also be very rewarding as Ed and Steve have become very close friends ever since their rocky start.

## Closing thoughts

This is a book I definitely want to keep on my bookshelf. I really enjoyed Ed’s down-to-earth and easy-to-understand writing style. Ed has done a great job at leading a creative organization, and his book captures a plethora of insights. From reading his book, Ed strikes me as someone who is always self-reflecting with himself and his company, always trying to get to the heart of the matters, and I think this quality was a big reason why he was successful in his leadership.
